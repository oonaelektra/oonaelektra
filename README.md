### Hi! My name is Oona and this is my personal repository! 

### My html skills can be reviewed in the oonaelektracello repository, which I built to make a personal cellist website.

### Other repositories include some classwork from my studies. At the moment I am working on muy bachelor's thesis and the repository including e.g. my MT training scripts will be made public later.
